II. Award Information 

Types of Awards: Discretionary grants 

and cooperative agreements. 

Fiscal Information: Although 
Congress has not yet enacted an 
appropriation for fiscal year 2017, the 
Institute is inviting applications for 
these competitions now so that 
applicants can have adequate time to 
prepare their applications. The 
Department may announce additional 
topics later in 2016. The actual award of 
grants will depend on the availability of 
funds. 

Estimated Range of Awards: See chart 

at the end of this notice. 

Estimated Size and Number of 

Awards: The size of the awards will 
depend on the scope of the projects 
proposed. The number of awards made 
under each competition will depend on 
the quality of the applications received 
for that competition, the availability of 
funds, and the following limits on 
awards for specific competitions and 
topics set by the Institute. See the chart 
at the end of this notice for additional 
information. 

The Institute may waive any of the 

following limits on awards for a specific 
competition or topic in the special case 
that the peer review process results in 
a tie between two or more grant 
applications, making it impossible to 
adhere to the limits without funding 
only some of the equally ranked 
applications. In that case, the Institute 
may make a larger number of awards to 
include all applications of the same 
rank.

competition, we will award no more 
than four grants under the Pathways to 
the Education Sciences Research 
Training topic. 

For NCER’s Research Networks 

Focused on Critical Problems of 
Education Policy and Practice 
competition, we will award no more 
than five grants under the Exploring 
Science Teaching in Elementary School 
Classrooms topic (one grant under the 
Network Lead and four grants under the 
Research Team) and four grants under 
the Scalable Strategies to Support 
College Completion topic (one grant 
under the Network Lead and three 
grants under the Research Team). 
For NCSER’s Research Training 

Programs in Special Education 
competition, we will award no more 
than five grants under the Early Career

For NCSER’s Low-Cost, Short- 

Duration Evaluation of Special 
Education Interventions, we will award 
no more than four grants. 

The Institute may change the 

maximum number of awards per 
competition through a notice in the 
Federal Register. Contingent on the 
availability of funds and the quality of 
applications, we may make additional 
awards in FY 2018 from the list of 
unfunded applications from the FY 
2017 competitions. 

Note: The Department is not bound by any 

estimates in this notice. 

Project Period: See chart at the end of 

this notice.

12087 

Application packages for grants under 

these competitions must be obtained 
from and submitted electronically using 
the Grants.gov Apply site 
(www.Grants.gov). For information 
(including dates and times) about how 
to submit your application package 
electronically, or in paper format by 
mail or hand delivery if you qualify for 
an exception to the electronic 
submission requirement, please refer to 
Other Submission Requirements in 
section IV of this notice. 

Other Submission Requirements of 

this notice. 

Individuals with disabilities who 

need an accommodation or auxiliary aid 
in connection with the application 
process should contact the person listed 
under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION 
CONTACT in section VII of this notice and 
the chart at the end of this notice. If the 
Department provides an accommodation 
or auxiliary aid to an individual with a 
disability in connection with the 
application process, the individual’s 
application remains subject to all other 
requirements and limitations in this 
notice. 

4. Intergovernmental Review: This 

competition is not subject to Executive 
Order 12372 and the regulations in CFR 
part 79. 

5. Funding Restrictions: We reference 

regulations outlining funding 
restrictions in the Applicable 
Regulations section of this notice. 

6. Data Universal Numbering System 

Number, Taxpayer Identification 
Number, and System for Award 
Management: To do business with the 
Department of Education, you must— 
a. Have a Data Universal Numbering 

System (DUNS) number and a Taxpayer 
Identification Number (TIN); 

b. Register both your DUNS number 

and TIN with the System for Award 
Management (SAM) (formerly the 
Central Contractor Registry), the 
Government’s primary registrant 
database; 

c. Provide your DUNS number and 

TIN on your application; and 
d. Maintain an active SAM 

registration with current information 
while your application is under review 
by the Department and, if you are 
awarded a grant, during the project 
period. 

You can obtain a DUNS number from 

Dun and Bradstreet at the following 
Web site: http://fedgov.dnb.com/ 
webform. A DUNS number can be 
created within one to two business days. 

If you are a corporate entity, agency, 

institution, or organization, you can 
obtain a TIN from the Internal Revenue 
Service. If you are an individual, you 
can obtain a TIN from the Internal 

Revenue Service or the Social Security 
Administration. If you need a new TIN, 
please allow two to five weeks for your 
TIN to become active. 

The SAM registration process can take 
approximately seven business days, but 
may take upwards of several weeks, 
depending on the completeness and 
accuracy of the data you enter into the 
SAM database. Thus, if you think you 
might want to apply for Federal 
financial assistance under a program 
administered by the Department, please 
allow sufficient time to obtain and 
register your DUNS number and TIN. 
We strongly recommend that you 
register early. 

Note: Once your SAM registration is active, 

you will need to allow 24 to 48 hours before 
you can access the information in, and 
submit an application through, Grants.gov. 
If you are currently registered with 
SAM, you may not need to make any 
changes. However, please make certain 
that the TIN associated with your DUNS 
number is correct. Also, note that you 
will need to update your registration 
annually. This may take three or more 
business days. 

Information about SAM is available at 

www.SAM.gov. To further assist you 
with obtaining and registering your 
DUNS number and TIN in SAM or 
updating your existing SAM account, 
we have prepared a SAM.gov Tip Sheet, 
which you can find at: www2.ed.gov/ 
fund/grant/apply/sam-faqs.html. 

In addition, if you are submitting your 
application via Grants.gov, you must (1) 
be designated by your organization as an 
Authorized Organization Representative 
(AOR); and (2) register yourself with 
Grants.gov as an AOR. Details on these 
steps are outlined at the following 
Grants.gov Web page: www.grants.gov/ 
web/grants/register.html.

system—after 4:30:00 p.m., Washington, 
DC time, on the application deadline 
date. We do not consider an application 
that does not comply with the deadline 
requirements. When we retrieve your 
application from Grants.gov, we will 
notify you if we are rejecting your 
application because it was date and time 
stamped by the Grants.gov system after 
4:30:00 p.m., Washington, DC time, on 
the application deadline date. 
• The amount of time it can take to 

upload an application will vary 
depending on a variety of factors, 
including the size of the application and 
the speed of your Internet connection. 
Therefore, we strongly recommend that 
you do not wait until the application 
deadline date to begin the submission 
process through Grants.gov. 
• You should review and follow the 
Education Submission Procedures for 
submitting an application through 
Grants.gov that are included in the 
application package for the competition 
to ensure that you submit your 
application in a timely manner to the 
Grants.gov system. You can also find the 
Education Submission Procedures 
pertaining to Grants.gov under News 
and Events on the Department’s G5 
system home page at www.G5.gov. In 
addition, for specific guidance and 
procedures for submitting an 
application through Grants.gov, please 
refer to the Grants.gov Web site at: 
www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/
apply-for-grants.html. 

• You will not receive additional 
point value because you submit your 
application in electronic format, nor 
will we penalize you if you qualify for 
an exception to the electronic 
submission requirement, as described 
elsewhere in this section, and submit 
your application in paper format. 
• You must submit all documents 

electronically, including all information 
you typically provide on the following 
forms: the Application for Federal 
Assistance (SF 424), the Department of 
Education Supplemental Information for 
SF 424, Budget Information—Non- 
Construction Programs (ED 524), and all 
necessary assurances and certifications. 

• You must upload any narrative 
sections and all other attachments to 
your application as files in a read-only 
non-modifiable Portable Document 
Format (PDF). Do not upload an 
interactive or fillable PDF file. If you 
upload a file type other than a read- 
only, non-modifiable PDF (e.g., Word, 
Excel, WordPerfect, etc.) or submit a 
password-protected file, we will not 
review that material. Please note that 
this could result in your application not 
being considered for funding because

the project narrative—is critical to a 
meaningful review of your proposal. For 
that reason it is important to allow 
yourself adequate time to upload all 
material as PDF files. The Department 
will not convert material from other 
formats to PDF. 
• Your electronic application must 

comply with any page-limit 
requirements described in the relevant 
RFA for your application. 

• After you electronically submit 

your application, you will receive from 
Grants.gov an automatic notification of 
receipt that contains a Grants.gov 
tracking number. (This notification 
indicates receipt by Grants.gov only, not 
receipt by the Department.) Grants.gov 
will also notify you automatically by 
email if your application met all the 
Grants.gov validation requirements or if 
there were any errors (such as 
submission of your application by 
someone other than a registered 
Authorized Organization 
Representative, or inclusion of an 
attachment with a file name that 
contains special characters). You will be 
given an opportunity to correct any 
errors and resubmit, but you must still 
meet the deadline for submission of 
applications. 

Once your application is successfully 
validated by Grants.gov, the Department 
will retrieve your application from 
Grants.gov and send you an email with 
a unique PR/Award number for your 
application. 

These emails do not mean that your 

application is without any disqualifying 
errors. While your application may have 
been successfully validated by 
Grants.gov, it must also meet the 
Department’s application requirements 
as specified in this notice and in the 
application instructions. Disqualifying 
errors could include, for instance, 
failure to upload attachments in a read- 
only, non-modifiable PDF; failure to 
submit a required part of the 
application; or failure to meet applicant 
eligibility requirements. It is your 
responsibility to ensure that your 
submitted application has met all of the 
Department’s requirements. 
• We may request that you provide us 

original signatures on forms at a later 
date. 

Application Deadline Date Extension 

in Case of Technical Issues with the 
Grants.gov System: If you are

V. Application Review Information 
1. Selection Criteria: The selection 

criteria for these competitions are 
provided in the RFAs. 

2. Review and Selection Process: We 

remind potential applicants that in 
reviewing applications in any 
discretionary grant competition, the 
Secretary may consider, under 34 CFR 
75.217(d)(3), the past performance of the 
applicant in carrying out a previous 
award, such as the applicant’s use of 
funds, achievement of project 
objectives, and compliance with grant 
conditions. The Secretary may also 
consider whether the applicant failed to 
submit a timely performance report or 
submitted a report of unacceptable 
quality. 

In addition, in making a competitive 
grant award, the Secretary also requires 
various assurances including those 
applicable to Federal civil rights laws 
that prohibit discrimination in programs 
or activities receiving Federal financial 
assistance from the Department of 
Education (34 CFR 100.4, 104.5, 106.4, 
108.8, and 110.23). 

3. Special Conditions: Under 2 CFR 

3474.10, the Secretary may impose 
special conditions and, in appropriate 
circumstances, high-risk conditions on a 
grant in regards to key aspects of the 
proposed research design and if the 
applicant or grantee is not financially 
stable; has a history of unsatisfactory 
performance; has a financial or other 
management system that does not meet 
the standards in 2 CFR part 200, subpart 
D; has not fulfilled the conditions of a 

prior grant; or is otherwise not 
responsible. 
VI. Award Administration Information 
1. Award Notices: If your application 

is successful, we notify your U.S. 
Representative and U.S. Senators and 
send you a Grant Award Notification 
(GAN); or we may send you an email 
containing a link to access an electronic 
version of your GAN. We may notify 
you informally, also. 

If your application is not evaluated or 
not selected for funding, we notify you. 
2. Administrative and National Policy 

Requirements: We identify 
administrative and national policy 
requirements in the application package 
and reference these and other 
requirements in the Applicable 
Regulations section of this notice. 

We reference the regulations outlining 
the terms and conditions of an award in 
the Applicable Regulations section of 
this notice and include these and other 
specific conditions in the GAN. The 
GAN also incorporates your approved 
application as part of your binding 
commitments under the grant. 

3. Grant Administration: Applicants 

should budget for an annual two-day 
meeting for project directors to be held 
in Washington, DC. 

4. Reporting: (a) If you apply for a 
grant under one of the competitions 
announced in this notice, you must 
ensure that you have in place the 
necessary processes and systems to 
comply with the reporting requirements 
in 2 CFR part 170 should you receive 
funding under the competition. This 
does not apply if you have an exception 
under 2 CFR 170.110(b). 

(b) At the end of your project period, 

you must submit a final performance 
report, including financial information, 
as directed by the Secretary. If you 
receive a multi-year award, you must 
submit an annual performance report 
that provides the most current 
performance and financial expenditure 
information as directed by the Secretary 
under 34 CFR 75.118. The Secretary 
may also require more frequent 
performance reports under 34 CFR 
75.720(c). For specific requirements on 
reporting, please go to www.ed.gov/
fund/grant/apply/appforms/
appforms.html. 

5. Performance Measures: To evaluate 

the overall success of its education 
research and special education research 
grant programs, the Institute annually 
assesses the percentage of projects that 
result in peer-reviewed publications, the 
number of newly developed or modified 
interventions with evidence of promise 
for improving student education 
outcomes, and the number of Institute-

supported interventions with evidence 
of efficacy in improving student 
outcomes including school readiness 
outcomes for young children and 
student academic outcomes and social 
and behavioral competencies for school- 
age students. School readiness outcomes 
include pre-reading, reading, pre- 
writing, early mathematics, early 
science, and social-emotional skills that 
prepare young children for school. 
Student academic outcomes include 
learning and achievement in core 
academic content areas (reading, 
writing, math, and science) and 
outcomes that reflect students’ 
successful progression through the 
education system (e.g., course and grade 
completion; high school graduation; 
postsecondary enrollment, progress, and 
completion). Social and behavioral 
competencies include social and 
emotional skills, attitudes, and 
behaviors that may be important to 
student’s academic and post-academic 
success. Additional education outcomes 
for students with or at risk of disability 
include developmental outcomes for 
infants and toddlers (birth to age three) 
with or at risk for a disability pertaining 
to cognitive, communicative, linguistic, 
social, emotional, adaptive, functional, 
or physical development; and 
developmental and functional outcomes 
that improve education outcomes, 
transition to employment, independent 
living, and postsecondary education for 
students with disabilities. 

6. Continuation Awards: In making a 

continuation award under 34 CFR 
75.253, the Secretary considers, among 

other things: whether a grantee has 
made substantial progress in meeting 
the goals and objectives of the project; 
whether the grantee has expended funds 
in a manner that is consistent with its 
approved application and budget; and, 
if the Secretary has established 
performance measurement 
requirements, whether the grantee has 
met the performance targets in the 
grantee’s approved application. 

In making a continuation award, the 

Secretary also considers whether the 
grantee is operating in compliance with 
the assurances in its approved 
application, including those applicable 
to Federal civil rights laws that prohibit 
discrimination in programs or activities 
receiving Federal financial assistance 
from the Department (34 CFR 100.4, 
104.5, 106.4, 108.8, and 110.23).

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY 

Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission 
[Docket No. CP15–518–000] 

Freeport LNG Development, L.P., FLNG 
Liquefaction, LLC, FLNG Liquefaction 
2, LLC, FLNG Liquefaction 3, LLC; 
Notice of Schedule for Environmental 
Review of the Freeport LNG Capacity 
Uprate Project 

On June 15, 2015, Freeport LNG 

Development, L.P., FLNG Liquefaction, 
LLC, FLNG Liquefaction 2, LLC, and 
FLNG Liquefaction 3, LLC (collectively 
referred to as Freeport LNG) filed an 
application pursuant to Section 3(a) of 
the Natural Gas Act to amend the 
existing authorization for the 
Liquefaction Project, located in Brazoria 
County near Freeport, Texas. The 
proposed project is known as the 
Capacity Uprate Project (Project), and 
would allow for the liquefaction and 
export of an additional 0.34 billion 
cubic feet per day (bcf/d) equivalent of 
liquefied natural gas. 

On June 24, 2015, the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (Commission or 
FERC) issued its Notice of Application 
for the Project. Among other things, that 
notice alerted agencies issuing federal 
authorizations of the requirement to 
complete all necessary reviews and to 
reach a final decision on a request for 
a federal authorization within 90 days of 
the date of issuance of the Commission 
staff’s Environmental Assessment (EA) 
for the Project. This instant notice 
identifies the FERC staff’s planned 
schedule for the completion of the EA 
for the Project. 
Schedule for Environmental Review 
Issuance of EA March 31, 2016 
90-day Federal Authorization Decision 

Deadline
If a schedule change becomes 

June 29, 2016 

necessary, additional notice will be 
provided so that the relevant agencies 
are kept informed of the Project’s 
progress. 
Project Description 

Freeport LNG is seeking approval of 

an increase in the LNG production 
capacity of the previously approved 
Liquefaction Project from 1.8 bcf/d to 
about 2.14 Bcf/d. This is the estimated 
maximum LNG production capacity of 
the Liquefaction Project available for 
export under optimal operating 
conditions. The currently authorized 

liquefaction capacity for the 
Liquefaction Project was determined by 
Freeport LNG during the early stages 
engineering design. This amendment 
identifies and requests that the 
maximum quantity of LNG that could be 
produced in a particular year under 
well-developed engineering design 
parameters and specific operating 
conditions be used as the approved 
volumes. 
Background 

Freeport LNG identified no additional 
facilities or modification that would be 
necessary to enable the uprate. We 
received a request to intervene from the 
Sierra Club that included some 
environmental comments. 
Additional Information 

In order to receive notification of the 
issuance of the EA and to keep track of 
all formal issuances and submittals in 
specific dockets, the Commission offers 
a free service called eSubscription. This 
can reduce the amount of time you 
spend researching proceedings by 
automatically providing you with 
notification of these filings, document 
summaries, and direct links to the 
documents. Go to www.ferc.gov/docs- 
filing/esubscription.asp. 

Additional information about the 

Project is available from the 
Commission’s Office of External Affairs 
at (866) 208–FERC or on the FERC Web 
site (www.ferc.gov). Using the 
‘‘eLibrary’’ link, select ‘‘General Search’’ 
from the eLibrary menu, enter the 
selected date range and ‘‘Docket 
Number’’ excluding the last three digits 
(i.e., CP15–518), and follow the 
instructions. For assistance with access 
to eLibrary, the helpline can be reached 
at (866) 208–3676, TTY (202) 502–8659, 
or at FERCOnlineSupport@ferc.gov. The 
eLibrary link on the FERC Web site also

documents issued by the Commission, 
such as orders, notices, and rule 
makings.

issued for a period ending February 28, 
2016. Section 15(a)(1) of the FPA, 16 
U.S.C. 808(a)(1), requires the 
Commission, at the expiration of a 
license term, to issue from year-to-year 
an annual license to the then licensee 
under the terms and conditions of the 
prior license until a new license is 
issued, or the project is otherwise 
disposed of as provided in section 15 or 
any other applicable section of the FPA. 
If the project’s prior license waived the 
applicability of section 15 of the FPA, 
then, based on section 9(b) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 
558(c), and as set forth at 18 CFR 
16.21(a), if the licensee of such project 
has filed an application for a subsequent 
license, the licensee may continue to 
operate the project in accordance with 
the terms and conditions of the license 
after the minor or minor part license 
expires, until the Commission acts on 
its application. If the licensee of such a 
project has not filed an application for 
a subsequent license, then it may be 
required, pursuant to 18 CFR 16.21(b), 
to continue project operations until the 
Commission issues someone else a 
license for the project or otherwise 
orders disposition of the project. 

If the project is subject to section 15 
of the FPA, notice is hereby given that 
an annual license for Project No. 308 is 
issued to the licensee for a period 
effective March 1, 2016 through 
February 28, 2017 or until the issuance 
of a new license for the project or other 
disposition under the FPA, whichever 
comes first. If issuance of a new license 
(or other disposition) does not take 
place on or before February 28, 2017, 
notice is hereby given that, pursuant to 
18 CFR 16.18(c), an annual license 
under section 15(a)(1) of the FPA is 
renewed automatically without further 
order or notice by the Commission,
